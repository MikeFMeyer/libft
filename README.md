## Installation:

To get started, clone the Libft repo and go into the folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/mikefmeyer/libft
cd libft/
```

### Making:

To compile the libft, you need to run the following commands:

```
make
```

## Using the library:

To use the library, you need to add "#include "libft.h"" in your name and change the directory of your libft.h.
If you add a function to the library, you'll need to add the function in the libft.h file and the Makefile.

### Compiling with libft.a

Run the following command, by adding your main file and all other files you want to compile.

```
gcc [Your Main] [Other Files] libft.a
./a.out
```
